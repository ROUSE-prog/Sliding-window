## There are many algorithms that come up frequently in coding interviews, with Sliding Windows being one of the most popular.



### Basic Concept: The sliding window algorithm involves moving a window of fixed size over a data structure (like an array or string) to process a subset of its elements at any given time.
        The sliding window algorithm is a methodical approach to managing a subset of data within a larger set. It is akin to peering through a small window that only reveals a portion of the entire scene. This window 'slides' over the data structure, like a magnifying glass moving across a page of text, allowing you to examine and process sequential segments of the data in manageable, bite-sized chunks.

 ### Use Cases: Sliding window algorithms are widely used in various domains, including string manipulation (e.g., finding substrings), array processing (e.g., finding maximum sum of subarrays of a given size). 
        String Manipulation: In string processing, this algorithm is instrumental in tasks like searching for patterns or substrings. For example, finding all occurrences of a particular word within a text, or checking if a string contains an anagram of another string.
        Array Processing: It is heavily used in analyzing numerical arrays. This includes finding the maximum or minimum sum of a consecutive subarray of a fixed size, or identifying the longest subarray meeting certain criteria, like having elements with a sum less than a given value.

### Window Size: The size of the window is predefined and remains constant throughout the operation. It determines the number of elements processed at each step.
        The window size is crucial as it defines the scope of data being processed at any point. In a way, it's like setting the zoom level of a camera lens. A larger window provides a broader view (processing more elements at once), while a smaller window offers a more focused and detailed view (processing fewer elements).

 ### Moving the Window: The window slides one element at a time from left to right (or in a specified direction) across the data structure. At each step, a new element enters the window from one end, and an old element exits from the other end.
        As the window slides, it's similar to turning the pages of a book one page at a time. With each slide, you discard the oldest piece of information (the leftmost element, in most cases) and welcome a new piece of information (the rightmost element). This continuous movement ensures that every segment of the data structure is examined without any overlap or omission.

### Processing Elements: Within each window, a specific operation or a set of operations is performed. This could include calculations like finding the sum, average, minimum, or maximum, or applying a filter or a pattern matching.
        Each window frame serves as a workshop where specific operations are conducted on the elements within. This is where the magic happens - calculations or transformations are applied to this subset of data. The nature of these operations can vary widely, from simple arithmetic (like summing numbers) to more complex procedures (like evaluating if the elements in the window match a certain pattern). This process is repeated for each position of the window, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the entire dataset.

### Javascript function!
    `function fixedSlidingWindow(arr, k) {
    // Sum up the first subarray and add it to the result
    let currSubarray = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    let result = [currSubarray];

    // To get each subsequent subarray, add the next value in the array and remove the first value
    for (let i = 1; i <= arr.length - k; i++) {
        currSubarray = currSubarray - arr[i - 1];
        currSubarray = currSubarray + arr[i + k - 1];
        result.push(currSubarray);
    }

    return result;
    }`
    
    1. Declares a function named fixedSlidingWindow which takes two parameters: arr (the input array) and k (the size of the window).

    2. Slices the first k elements from arr and reduces them to their sum. This sum represents the sum of the first subarray (or window).

    3. Initializes an array result and stores the sum of the first subarray in it.

    4. Starts a loop from 1 to arr.length - k to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of each sliding window.

    5. Subtracts the first element of the previous window and adds the next element of the current window to currSubarray. This step effectively slides the window to the right by one position.

    6. Adds the updated currSubarray sum to the result array.

    7. After the loop completes, the function returns the result array, which contains the sum of each subarray of size k.
